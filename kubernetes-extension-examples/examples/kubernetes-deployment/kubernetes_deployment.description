//Ballerina supports generating Kubernetes artifacts based on annotations.
//A single Ballerina module is mapped to a single Kubernetes deployment.
//Minikube or Docker for Mac/Windows should be configured and
//Kubernetes should be enabled to run the example.
//This example deploys an HTTPS service, which retrieves values from a config file to Kubernetes.
//Before running the sample, create a directory named `security` inside current working directory
//from where the ballerina build command will be issued.
//Then copy the ballerinaKeystore.p12 and ballerinaTruststore.p12 files
//located in https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/tree/master/examples/resources/
//to the security folder.<br/><br/>
